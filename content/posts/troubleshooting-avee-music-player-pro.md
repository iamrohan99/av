Avee Music Player Pro is a versatile app known for its customizable audio visualizers and broad media format support. However, like any software, users may encounter issues. This guide will help you troubleshoot some common problems.

## Audio Problems

### No Sound or Distorted Audio
1. **Check Volume and Audio Settings**: Ensure your device volume is turned up and not muted. Verify that Avee Player's internal volume settings are correctly adjusted.
2. **Restart the App**: Sometimes, restarting the app can resolve temporary glitches.
3. **Check File Format Compatibility**: Avee supports many formats, but ensure your audio files are not corrupted or in an unsupported format.

### Hissing or Background Noise
1. **Re-encode Audio Files**: If you notice a persistent hissing noise, try re-encoding your audio files with a different codec.
2. **Update the App**: Ensure you are using the latest version of Avee Music Player Pro, as updates often fix bugs related to audio playback.

## Video Export Issues

### Failed to Initialize Video Encoder
1. **Clear Cache**: Go to your device settings, find Avee Player, and clear its cache. This can resolve many encoding issues.
2. **Check Storage Space**: Ensure you have sufficient storage space on your device for video exports.
3. **Adjust Export Settings**: Lower the resolution or bitrate in the export settings to reduce the load on your device's processor.

### Exported Video Has No Audio
1. **Check Audio Settings**: Ensure that the audio track is selected and correctly configured in the export settings.
2. **Use Supported Formats**: Export the video in a widely supported format like MP4 to avoid compatibility issues.

## App Crashes

### Frequent Crashes or Freezing
1. **Update the App**: Always use the latest version of Avee Music Player Pro.
2. **Reinstall the App**: Uninstalling and reinstalling the app can clear out any corrupted files that may be causing crashes.
3. **Check for Device Compatibility**: Ensure your device meets the minimum requirements for running Avee Player Pro smoothly.
